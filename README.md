# Gator-X

## Project Description:
Want to eat out but can’t decide where? Want to tour new places but can’t figure out what to do?

Gator-X is here to your rescue!

Exploring new places is fun but figuring out what to do can be perplexing. Gator-X is designed with the intention of elaborately expressing one's views about a café or museum. A user can easily browse through the reviews about a place that helps them to make an informed choice and thus enhance their experience. Gator-X stands for Gator-Experience! 

The primary location kept in mind while designing this website is Gainesville, the home of Gators. Though Gainesville is mostly seen as a town of students, it has a diverse population distribution catering needs of various age groups. It often gets tough for people to identify the places that suit their taste especially if they are new to the city. Gator-X provides an opportunity for visitors/residents to find new adventures and meet like-minded people in the process. A user can post, edit, delete and view reviews posted on the app. They can search and filter the posts according to different categories. Hence, Gator-X helps users save time and make the most of their time spent in Gator-land.
